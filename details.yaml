    \ Analysis from Online \nReviews \n \nWeb Scraping with Selenium \nWeb scraping\
    \ is when one automates the collection of content and data from websites by \n\
    extracting the underlying HTML code. This technique differs from screen scraping,\
    \ which \ncaptures what is displayed visually on the screen. The importance of\
    \ data analysis has grown \nalongside the availability of huge volumes of raw\
    \ data hence resulting in development of \nspecialized Python packages that simplify\
    \ web scraping. \nSelenium  as an open-source project provides a range of tools\
    \ and  libraries  for browser \nautomation. Among them is a playback tool (Selenium\
    \ IDE) that allows creation of test for \nmost modern browsers without any knowledge\
    \ about specific scripting languages necessary \nfor testing. With Selenium web\
    \ scraping, automated gathering of essential information through \nSelenium WebDriver\
    \ Browser Automation is possible. \nFor example, Selenium web scrapers can extract\
    \ data from following Amazon review pages \nfor Intel products: \nIntel Core i5-12500\
    \ Processor \nIntel i3-13300 Desktop Processor \nIntel i5-13500 Desktop Processor\
    \ \nIntel i7-13700 Desktop Processor \nUsing selenium for web scraping makes the\
    \ extraction process easier and speeds up collecting \nand analysing review data\
    \ from several pages. \nData Preprocessing \nFeatures Offered \nThe dataset has\
    \ columns named title, description and sentiment. Usually, in the title column,\
    \ a \nbrief description is given of the review provided by the client that may\
    \ often indicate either \nproduct names or satisfaction degree. The description\
    \ column is for writing more about the \nproduct; it includes things like features,\
    \ performance, quality and customer experiences and comments on another level.\
    \ It goes further to provide an analysis based on usability, reliability \namong\
    \ other factors as well as giving an overall evaluation of what customers think.\
    \ \nThis project uses TextBlob to analyze sentiment from different Intel products\
    \ reviews. Reviews \nare classified into positive, negative or neutral by polarity\
    \ scores using TextBlob: a score above \n0 indicates positive while below zero\
    \ represets negative while a score equaling zero means \nneural. It also allows\
    \ user to identify whether each review was positive, negative or neutral \nthrough\
    \ its broad sentiment score. \nLoading the Data(Data Collection) \nVarious Amazon\
    \ links were used to obtain Intel product reviews. This data was scraped from\
    \ \nmultiple  pages  and  loaded  into  a  CSV  file  for  more  analysis  purposes.\
    \  The \nmerged_amazon_reviews.csv file consists of columns \u2013 title; rating\
    \ and description. \nOn this ground, rating column which shows overall rate given\
    \ by customer has been removed \ndue to repetition. \nA sentiment column was added\
    \ to the dataset using TextBlob so as to show if any review is \npositive or not\
    \ (or if some are neutral). The words in the review help determine its sentiment.\
    \ \nTextBlob detects and classifies the sentiment, enabling a count of positive\
    \ and negative reviews \nto assess the product's overall sentiment.  \n \nData\
    \ Cleaning  \nThe  raw  data  extracted  from  Amazon  review  pages  is  cleaned\
    \  for  efficient  processing. \nUnwanted elements such as lowercase letters and\
    \ special characters are removed. Non-English \nreviews are eliminated, and English\
    \ reviews are corrected for grammatical and vocabulary \nerrors. Common English\
    \ words like \"a\" and \"the\" are removed. Emojis are converted to text \nformat.\
    \ \n \nExploratory Data Analysis\n \n \nThis dataset is organized into title,\
    \ description and sentiment columns where TextBlob \nuses it to classify Intel\
    \ product reviews into positive, negative or neutral categories based on \npolarity\
    \ scores. \nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) also includes sentiment score distributions\
    \ analysis, word \nfrequencies and correlations between review length and sentiment.\
    \ These visualizations \ninclude histograms, bar charts, and word clouds which\
    \ show patterns and common themes in \nthe data. EDA provides useful insights\
    \ into pattern of the data for guiding further analysis and \nmodeling. \n Random\
    \ Forest Classification\n \n \nA powerful and flexible machine learning algorithm\
    \ known as Random Forest Classification \n(RFC) is what this paper is about. \n\
    It involves creating multiple decision trees during training phase and obtaining\
    \ the mode of \nthe classes (classification) of the individual trees. This ensemble\
    \ approach helps to reduce \noverfitting and increase accuracy hence making RFC\
    \ one of the most effective algorithms in \na wide variety of projects. \n \n\
    The RFC technique operates by constructing a set of randomly created decision\
    \ trees that are \neach based on random subsets of data. During classification,\
    \ each individual tree produces a \nclass prediction, with the final prediction\
    \ being determined by majority voting across all \ntrees. This method improves\
    \ this model\u2019s robustness together with its accuracy by mitigating \nany\
    \ variance that may be caused by single tree. \n \nIn this project, we have chosen\
    \ RFC because it is more efficient and performs better than \nother tools. Its\
    \ ability to handle high-dimensional large datasets and its resistance against\
    \ \noverfitting positions it as an appropriate choice. With RFC we have been able\
    \ to achieve high \naccuracy and reliability in our classification tasks so that\
    \ precise and dependable results can \nbe obtained. \nConclusion \nOur analysis\
    \ on customer reviews of Intel products benefited from the use of Selenium for\
    \ web \nscraping, TextBlob for sentiment analysis and RFC for classification.\
    \ From this analysis, we \nhave been able to obtain insights that give an overall\
    \ picture of how customers feel about Intel\u2019s \nproducts. These insights\
    \ are crucial in making informed business decisions that improve \nproduct strategies.\
    \ Additionally, this project demonstrates the need to marry web scraping with\
    \ \nadvanced data analysis techniques in order to extract meaningful insights\
    \ from big data. "
